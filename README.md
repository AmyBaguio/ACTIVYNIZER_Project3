# Final Project - ActivyNizer

## Description
An App designed for Family to utilise in recording activities/events. Daily activities can be viewed via the calendar and an sms reminder is set up for family members to be reminded of today’s activity. The App will also help family member’s to avoid committing to different event at the same time.

## User Story
As a busy mom, I wanted an App that would record all my families activities and events. All members will have one single sign On to access the App.
I can view ‘ALL” the family members activities, events and special occasion. I will use this information to plan and avoid conflicts in commitment, and would be nice to receive an sms notification NOT a push notification and email which can be set aside/closed off when busy.
